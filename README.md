# Web_Scraper
Scrape lyrics off internet and make predictions

# [Project: Text Classification with Webscraping](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_04_project)
* Built a text classification model on song lyrics, the following was performed: 
	- Downloaded an HTML page with links to songs (https://www.lyrics.com)
	- Parsed HTML for hyperlinks to extract and download song lyrics
	- Vectorized the text using the Bag Of Words method and normalised the word counts with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
	- Trained a classification model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes/MultinomialNB) that predicts the artist from a piece of text
	- Created a shaped WordCloud for each artist

* Used Python, BeautifulSoup, RegEx, Glob, Pillow, WordCloud, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn
