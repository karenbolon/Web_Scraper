# [Project: Text Classification with Webscraping](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_04_project)
* Built a text classification model on song lyrics, the following was performed: 
	- Downloaded an HTML page with links to songs (https://www.lyrics.com)
	- Extracted hyperlinks of songs to download and extract song lyrics
	- Vectorized the text using the Bag Of Words method and normalised the word counts with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
	- Trained a classification model (logistic regression model) that predicts the artist from a piece of text
